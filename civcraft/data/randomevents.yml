# This file allows us to configure random events on the server.

# name - display name for the event
# message - message to display when event occurs.
# length - amount of time in hours to complete the requirements
# 
# The following sections are lists of components. Each represent and AND relationship
# this means all of them will be executed.
#
# actions - list of components that run when this event happens
# requirements- list of requirements that ALL must be completed to count as successful.
# success - list of components that run when this event is completed successfully
# failure - list of components that run when this event is failed.
