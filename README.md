# mycivcoalcraft-github

Hello! This is a developmental plugin that I suggest not except bug-free anytime soon, or to be balanced whatsoever. Many features will be either incomplete or completely broken, and do not expect them all to be fixed quickly. However, if you know how to setup a proper server and run it and wish to help test for bugs, you can gladly repot anything to:
https://github.com/YourCoalAlt/mycivcoalcraft-github/issues

Even though this GitHub was created for the intention of no one finding the code, it is nice that you found it. :) I hope you wish to take interest in it! If not, go on your way. :)
